Good morning, Mr Drake

When enemies negotiate, sometimes they need to use an intermediary. Sometimes they need to tell that intermediary information that has to be kept secret from the other party, so trust is essential.

The lawyers, Soames and Soames Ltd, have been the most trusted intermediaries for secret government negotiations around the world for the last fifteen years.

And they have a leak.

Someone inside the company is leaking secret information to an accomplice at a Dutch radio station, who broadcasts it in coded messages that are decyphered by the Ruritanians.  The Americans have asked us to identify the leak. 

The Americans have cracked the radio cypher, so we won't need to worry about how to obtain the messages themselves.  We just need to set up a tracking system that's going to record which lawyers have received which pieces of information. Some time later, when a broadcast is intercepted from the radio, we can look up who in Soames and Soames had that information in order to leak it.  After a few broadcasts to establish a pattern, we'll know who the culprit is.

And the American's won't.

If we can identify the leak inside Soames and Soames, this would be far too valuable an asset simply to arrest.  Instead, we will send agents in to turn the asset -- blackmailing them into working for us.  The second part of your mission will be to frame the leaker's boss. The Americans will take the boss into custody, elevating the leaker to a position of influence in the company -- a position that we will then control.

You will need to ensure that the database never appears to be inconsistent. If someone has asks twice who received some information, it must give the same answer both times. You can only change an answer if nobody has seen it yet.

If you choose to accept this mission, please clone the repository and get to work. It's all there in the tests.

regards,
W.
